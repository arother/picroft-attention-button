# Picroft Button for Attention

Given that Mycroft doesn't react on a wake word, I want to press a button to make mycroft listen

This might be useful with a less well-trained wakeword or when environment noise prevents from detection

Structure and parts are inspired (=taken ;) ) from https://github.com/andlo/picroft-google-aiy-voicekit-skill Thanks for the base!
